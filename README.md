# Notice

I published this right after starting development on [Mpris-Music-Label](https://github.com/Moon-0xff/mpris-music-label). This repository will not be maintained.

## Explanation

This is a fork of mheine's [spotify-label](https://github.com/mheine/gnome-shell-spotify-label).

Makes the extension work in any mpris compatible player. It also removes all non-core features and adds some of his own.

You can see this fork in his original context [here](https://github.com/Moon-0xff/gnome-shell-spotify-label) under the branch name 'multiple-player-featureless', a development branch which spiraled out of control and ultimately become a fork adjusted to my own taste.

## Further Development

the latest additions I was going to add to this repository replaced all but a hint of the original code.
So i decided to start a new repository from scratch. You can see it [here](https://github.com/Moon-0xff/mpris-music-label) under the name **Mpris-Music-Label**
